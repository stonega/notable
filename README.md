# Notable

Notable is a simple, fullscreen notebook that replaces your Chrome new tab page. It's designed for quick and easy note-taking, with all your data saved locally on your browser.

## Features

*   **Note List**: A sidebar on the left displays all your notes.
*   **Multi-window Support**: Each Chrome window gets its own active note, so you can work on different things in different windows.
*   **Local Storage**: All your notes are saved securely in your browser's local storage. No cloud, no accounts.
*   **Basic Note Management**: Create new notes, switch between them, and delete them easily.
